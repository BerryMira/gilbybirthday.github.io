            <p>To the one who holds my heart! Happy 17th Birthday! Wow, you're already a grown man, my love. I hope that you will enjoy your day today! I'm glad that I can experience celebrating your birthday again, since June 5, 2021 when we celebrated on Roblox too, that day was the best! I'm happy for who you've become now, a grown man but still, the sweetest and kind-hearted man that I have met! And I'll always cherish every moment that we've spent. I'll always thank God that he gave me you, a man who is always caring for me and always there through my lowest times. Thank you for doing all of that!</p>
            <p>We may have tough times, but we still stayed, my love. Congrats to us! An achievement that I always treasure in my heart.
</p>
<p>I'd also like to thank you for everything that you have done for me, my precious angel. Never forget that I'm always here for you, ready to provide never-ending support and love. If you have problems, never hesitate to talk to me. Cheers to your 17th Birthday, Gilby! Good luck on your Senior-High journey soon!</p>
